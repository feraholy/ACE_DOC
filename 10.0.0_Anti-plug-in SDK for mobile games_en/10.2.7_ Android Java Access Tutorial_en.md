* If your game has a global edition, please <font color="blue">contact the customer service</font> to get the guide on how to connect global game domain names and IPs to Anti-cheat SDK. (<font color="#dd0000">Anti-cheat SDK collects necessary user data to detect cheat behaviors. Please read the information in the data collection form in the SDK package carefully before connecting to and using the SDK.</font>)

## Precautions for Connection

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. We recommend you connect your game to both Anti-cheat SDK and broadcasting API to better combat cheats.
5. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
6. In order for Anti-cheat SDK to effectively defend against cheats, the Anti-cheat service must be within the validity period, and you must add the project package name of the game through the channel information in game management in the console.
```

## Overview

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required for connecting an Android game developed in Java to the SDK:

```xml
tp2.jar
libtersafe2.so
```

* The following permissions are required:

```xml
<!-- The SDK needs to collect the list of application installed on Android devices, and Android 11 requires declaration of the corresponding permission.
If `targetSdkVersion` of the application is equal to or above 30, you need to add the following permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file; otherwise, the SDK features will be affected: -->
否则会影响SDK功能。 -->
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES" />
<!-- Optional permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: initEx
2. User login API: onUserLogin
3. API for switching from foreground to background: onAppPause
4. API for switching from background to foreground: onAppResume
```

* Notes:

```xml
1. The original initialization API `init` of the SDK has been disused and replaced with `initEx` with the `appKey` parameter added.
```

## Connection Directions

### Step 1. Add SDK files to the project

1. Copy the `tp2.jar` file in the `sdk_android_java` directory to the `libs` directory in the Android project directory.
2. Copy the folders named after CPU architectures (including the `libtersafe2.so` file) in the `sdk_android_java/lib` directory to the `libs` directory in the Android project directory. There is no need to copy a folder if the corresponding CPU architecture isn't supported.

### Project attribute settings

1. In Eclipse, select your game project in **Project Explorer** on the left, right-click and select **Properties** in the pop-up menu, select **Java Build Path** on the left in the **Properties** window, and click **Add JARs** in **Library** to add `tp2.jar`.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/27/sdk_Android_java_02.jpg)
2. Select the `tp2.jar` file that has been copied to the project directory.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/27/sdk_Android_java_03.jpg)
3. After adding `tp2.jar`, select it in **Order and Export**.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/27/sdk_Android_java_04.jpg)
4. Clean and recompile the project.

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Import the package**

```java
import com.tencent.tersafe2.TP2Sdk;
```

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```java
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
int initEx(int gameId, String appKey);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----|---------|-----|
|gameId | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|appKey | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_Android.png)

* **User login API**

**Function prototype**

```java
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
int onUserLogin(int accountType, int worldId, String openId, String roleId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
| accountType | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `ENTRYID` below |
| worldId | Region information of the user's game character |
| openId | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string and cannot contain special symbols. It is required if punishment is involved |
| roleId | ID of the character created by the user |

For `accountType`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```java
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
class ENTRYID{
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_QZONE = 1; // QQ
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_MM = 2;  // WeChat
    public final static int ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK = 3; // Facebook
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_TWITTER = 4; // Twitter
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_LINE = 5; // Line
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP = 6; // WhatsApp
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7; // Game Center
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8; // Google Play
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_VK = 9; // VK
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU = 10;  // Kuaishou
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_APPLE = 11; // Apple
    public final static int ENTRY_ID_OTHERS = 99; // Other platforms
}
```

`worldId` is customized by the game. If the game has only one region, you can enter `0`.

`openId` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

`roleId` is used to distinguish between different characters of the same account in the same region. If there is only one character, you can enter "" (null).

* **API for switching from foreground to background**

**Function prototype**

```java
/**
If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
If the program is switched from the foreground to the background, the game is in inactive status.
*/
int onAppPause();
```

* **API for switching from background to foreground**

**Function prototype**

```java
/**
If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
If the program is switched from the background to the foreground, the game is in active status.
*/
int onAppResume ();
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`TP2Sdk.initEx` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `appKey`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`TP2Sdk.onUserLogin` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `TP2Sdk.onUserLogin` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.
也需要再次调用该函数。传递的参数为用户的帐号信息，可自定义

`TP2Sdk.onAppResume` should be called when the game is switched from the background to the foreground.

`TP2Sdk.onAppPause` should be called when the game is switched from the foreground to the background.
```

```java
public void onCreate() {
    // It is first called when the game is started
    TP2Sdk. initEx(9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");

    int accountType = ENTRYID.ENTRY_ID_QZONE;/*Account type*/
    int worldId = 101;  /*Region ID*/
    String openId = "B73B36366565F9E02C752";/*User ID related to the platform*/
    String roleId = "paladin";/*Character ID*/

    // It is called when the user logs in to the game
    TP2Sdk.onUserLogin(accountType, worldId, openId, roleId);
}

// Switch the game to the background
@Override
protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    TP2Sdk.onAppPause();
}

// Switch the game to the foreground
@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    TP2Sdk.onAppResume();
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

*Precautions for checking SDK connection:*

```xml
1. To combat cheats, make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game package name has been added to the channel information in ACE.
3. Check whether the feature of forced quit based on either-or can be normally used.
```

*Directions for checking SDK connection:*

1. Use a cheat to check whether the features of forced quit for trainers, speed adjusters, and VMs and either-or work. For the specific effect of cheat defense, please watch [this video](https://v.qq.com/x/page/y0868v09qgj.html) (note: to get the sample cheats used in the video, please contact the customer service).
2. Go to the [data query](#/console/service/query-data) page to check whether the relevant cheating information is displayed (note: there is a 5-minute delay for data display).
