* If your game has a global edition, please [contact the customer service](https://admin.qidian.qq.com/template/blue/mp/menu/qr-code-jump.html?linkType=0&env=ol&kfuin=2852167644&fid=28&key=d81ab0145faf07ade8b35f63efae4464&cate=1&type=16&ftype=1&_type=wpa&qidian=true) to get the guide on how to connect global game domain names and IPs to Anti-cheat SDK. (<font color="#dd0000">Anti-cheat SDK collects necessary user data to detect cheat behaviors. Please read the information in the data collection form in the SDK package carefully before connecting to and using the SDK.</font>)

## Precautions for Connection

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. We recommend you connect your game to both Anti-cheat SDK and broadcasting API to better combat cheats.
5. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
6. In order for Anti-cheat SDK to effectively defend against cheats, the Anti-cheat service must be within the validity period, and you must add the project package name of the game through the channel information in game management in the console.
```

## Overview

* We recommend you connect the game's library file as a dynamic library for the following benefits:

```xml
1. Smaller size: the size of a dynamic library file is much smaller than that of a static library, so you can reduce the size of the final package file.
2. Reduced symbol exposure: the internal symbols of a dynamic library aren't exposed, so you can minimize the possibility of symbol conflicts between the SDK and the game code.
3. Easier update: when updating the game project, you only need to replace `tersafe2.framework` instead of compiling the entire project again.
```

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required for connecting an iOS game to the SDK:

```xml
tersafe2.framework
```

* The following permissions are required:

```xml
Internet Access
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: tp2_sdk_init_ex
2. User login API: tp2_setuserinfo
3. Foreground/Background switch API: tp2_setgamestatus
```

* Notes:

```xml
1. The original initialization API `tp2_sdk_init` of the SDK has been disused and replaced with `tp2_sdk_init_ex` with the `app_key` parameter added.
```

## Integration Steps

### Step 1. Add SDK files to the project

1. Copy the `tersafe2.framework` package to any directory under the iOS project directory.
2. In **Build Phases** > **Link Binary With Libraries**, add reference to `tersafe2.framework`.
![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_001.jpg)
Note: `tersafe2.framework` should be in a parallel rather than dependent relationship with other dynamic libraries (including `UnityFramework.framework`).

3. In **Build Setting** > **Search Paths** > **Library Search Paths**, add the directory where `tersafe2.framework` is.
![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_002.jpg)

4. In **General** > **Embedded Binaries**, add the option of `tersafe2.framework`.
![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_001.png)

5. You can switch to **Build Phases** > **Embed Frameworks** to confirm that the **Destination** for adding `tersafe2.framework` is **Frameworks** and **Code Sign On Copy** is selected.
![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_002.png)

6. Set `iOS Deployment Target` to `iOS 8.0` (as only iOS 8.0 or above supports dynamic libraries).
In Xcode, switch to **Build Settings** to search for **iOS Deployment Target** and set it.
![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/u70.png)

### Project attribute settings

1. The SDK doesn't support bitcode; therefore, you need to disable bitcode in Xcode during compilation as shown below:
![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_02.png)

2. Configure compilation options (symbol removal settings).
3. You can remove the debug symbols from the program to make reverse engineering more difficult and increase the program's code security. To implement this, simply complete the following settings and recompile the game in Xcode:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_03.png)

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Header file**

```c++
#include "tersafe2/tp2_sdk.h"
```

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
int tp2_sdk_init_ex(int game_id, const char* app_key);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--- | -- | --|
|game_id | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|app_key | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_Android.png)

* **User login API**

```c++
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
int tp2_setuserinfo(int account_type, int world_id,
const char *open_id, const char *role_id);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|-----|
|account_type | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `TssSdkEntryId` below |
|world_id | Region information of the user's game character |
|open_id | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string. It is required if punishment is involved |
|role_id | ID of the character created by the user |

For `account_type`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```c++
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
enum TssSdkEntryId{
    ENTRY_ID_QZONE = 1,   // QQ
    ENTRY_ID_MM  = 2,  // WeChat
    ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK  = 3,  // Facebook
    ENTRY_ID_TWITTER  = 4,  // Twitter
    ENTRY_ID_LINE  = 5,  // Line
    ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP  = 6,  // WhatsApp
    ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7, // Game Center
    ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8, // Google Play
    ENTRY_ID_VK = 9, // VK
    ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU = 10, // Kuaishou
    ENTRY_ID_APPLE = 11, // Apple
    ENTRY_ID_OTHERS  = 99,  // Other platforms
}
```

`world_id` is customized by the game. If the game has only one region, you can enter `0`.

`role_id` is used to distinguish between different characters of the same account in the same region. If there is only one character, you can enter "" (null).

`open_id` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

* **Foreground/Background switch API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
int tp2_setgamestatus (int status);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|--- | ---|
|status | Foreground: TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND; background: TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND|

```c++
enum TP2GameStatus{
    TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND = 1,    // Foreground
    TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND = 2,    // Background
}
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`tp2_sdk_init_ex` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `app_key`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`tp2_setuserinfo` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `tp2_setuserinfo` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.
也需要再次调用该函数。传递的参数为用户的帐号信息，可自定义。

`tp2_setgamestatus` should be called when the game is switched to the foreground/background.
When switching the game from the background to the foreground, call the `tp2_setgamestatus` API and set the parameter to `TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND`.
When switching the game from the foreground to the background, pass in the `TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND` parameter value.
Some features of the SDK will stop running if the game is switched to the background. Therefore, this API will affect the normal operations of SDK features.

```

```c++

void game_start() {
    // It is first called when the game is started
    tp2_sdk_init_ex (9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");

    // It is called when the user logs in
    int account_type = ENTRY_ID_QZONE;  /*Account type*/
    int world_id = 101;  /*Region ID*/
    char open_id[] = "B73B36366565F9E02C752";/*User ID related to the platform*/
    char role_id[] = "paladin"; /*Character ID*/
    tp2_setuserinfo(account_type, world_id, open_id, role_id);
};

// Switch the game to the background
int game_pause(){
    return tp2_setgamestatus(TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND);
}

// Switch the game to the foreground
int game_resume(){
    return tp2_setgamestatus(TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND);
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. Make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game package name has been added to the iOS channel information in ACE.
3. Check whether the game client has been connected to the iOS broadcasting API.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

In 30–60 seconds after the SDK is started, check whether the following data is printed in the string data returned by the client broadcasting API; and if so, the SDK is properly started.
