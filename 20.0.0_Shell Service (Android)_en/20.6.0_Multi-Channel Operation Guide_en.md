When releasing a game, you often need to package it for multiple channels, which brings many troubles. This document describes multiple implementation methods of multi-channel packaging and provides ACE's solution to this problem.

## Multi-Channel Packaging Overview

If your game has multiple channel packages, you may have the following questions:

1. My game has 100 channel packages. Do I need to reinforce each package separately?
2. My game has 100 channel packages. Do I need to configure each package name in the console?
3. I reinforced the game base package first, but the generated channel packages cannot run normally. What should I do?
**……**

If you need to reinforce a game with dozens or even hundreds of channel packages, the simplest way is to reinforce each game package separately; however, this method costs a large amount of time and manpower.<br/>
<font color="#dd0000">I hope that all channel packages can run normally after the game base package is reinforced only once. </font>Is this feasible?<br/>
<font color="#dd0000">When generating multiple channel packages, a third-party packaging tool has multiple processing methods, which will be detailed below, and you only need to select a method accordingly.</font>

## Multi-Channel Packaging Scenarios

Reference documents for multi-channel package generation: [Next-Generation Open-Source Android Channel Package Generation Tool Walle](https://tech.meituan.com/2017/01/13/android-apk-v2-signature-scheme.html), [Three Methods of Generating Multiple Android Channel Packages](https://blog.csdn.net/mayn666/article/details/79878469), and [Generation of Multiple Android Channel Packages (Different Package Names for the Same Project)](https://www.jianshu.com/p/9bfc4b23b2c0)

### Scenario 1. Only the game resource files in the channel package are modified

<font color="red">This is the most common case, </font>where a third-party tool only modifies some resource files in the game when generating a channel package but doesn't modify other core logic modules. In this case, you can solve the problem by referring to solutions 1 and 2 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues).

### Scenario 2. Only the identifiable `block` field in the channel package is modified

Only the `block` field at the end of the game's .zip package is modified to mark the channel package as shown in Figure 1. In this case, no modifications are made on the logic modules and resource files in the game package, which therefore doesn't conflict with Shell Service Solution. You can solve the problem by referring to solution 3 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues).

<span class="legend">Figure 1. Only a `block` field is modified in the channel package</span>

### Scenario 3. The application entry of the .dex file in the channel package is modified

The application entry in the channel package is modified so that the channel package can be started first before other processes. This modification conflicts with Shell Service Solution and affects its start. In this case, you can solve the problem by referring to solution 1 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues).

### Scenario 4. Only the `AndroidMainfest.xml` file in the channel package is modified

The `AndroidManifest.xml` file in the channel package is modified. A `Metadata` tag is added to `Application` in the file to record the channel number so as to directly get the channel information from PackageManager. As the latest version of the reinforcement tool is compatible with such modification, this case doesn't conflict with Shell Service Solution, and you can solve the problem by referring to solution 3 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues).

### Scenario 5. A file is added to the `META-INF` directory in the channel package

The base APK package is decompressed directly, and a new file is added to the `META-INF` directory to record the channel number and generate a new channel package. In this case, no modifications are made on the logic modules and resource files in the game package, which therefore doesn't conflict with Shell Service Solution. You can solve the problem by referring to solution 1 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues). However, you should note that only when a v1 signature is used for base package reinforcement can the game be installed normally; if a v2 signature is used, the package will fail the verification.

### Scenario 6. The `channel.txt` file for channel number recording is added to the base package

A `channel.txt` file is directly added to the APK package during packaging. To generate a channel package, the base package is decompressed and the file is modified to record the channel number for generation of the new channel package. In this case, no modifications are made on the logic modules and resource files in the game package, which therefore doesn't conflict with Shell Service Solution. However, you should ensure that the `channel.txt` file isn't among the files to be verified in the configuration file before reinforcement. You can solve the problem by referring to solution 2 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues).

### Scenario 7. The package name is modified for the channel package

The package name is modified during packaging, so different channel packages have different package names, and the statistics of channels are collected directly by package name. This modification conflicts with Shell Service Solution and affects its start. In this case, you can solve the problem by referring to solution 1 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues).

### Scenario 8. Channel data is inserted during channel signing

The channel data is inserted when the base APK package is signed in order to insert such data in the optional extended node of APK Signature Scheme v2. In this case, no modifications are made on the logic modules and resource files in the game package, which therefore doesn't conflict with Shell Service Solution. You can solve the problem by referring to solution 3 [here](#Solutions-to-Multi-Channel-Packaging-Issues). However, you should note that only a v2 signature can be used for base package reinforcement.

## Solutions to Multi-Channel Packaging Issues

### Solution 1. Generate channel packages first and then batch reinforce them <font color="red">(recommended)</font>

This reinforcement method can be performed on web or the command line. If multiple channel packages need to be batch reinforced, we recommend you use the command line-based reinforcement tool (<a href="#/tool-center">click here to download it</a>) as instructed in <a href="#/doc-center/665803a46e549f4ae4c401e7b36bb13c57639823">Operation Guide</a>. The detailed steps are as shown in Figure 2.

<span class="legend">Figure 2. Steps to reinforce the base package</span>

### Solution 2. Reinforce the base package with partial verification selected by default to narrow the resource protection scope

The feature of setting the resource file protection scope is provided during reinforcement (configuration in web-based reinforcement is as shown in Figure 3, and for more information on the configuration in command line-based reinforcement, please see <a href="#/doc-center/665803a46e549f4ae4c401e7b36bb13c57639823">Operation Guide</a>). If you know which files will be modified by the third-party tool, you can choose not to verify such files during reinforcement.

<span class="legend">Figure 3. Deselect the resource files that don't need to be verified before reinforcement</span>

The steps of this solution are simple as shown in Figure 4.

<span class="legend">Figure 4. Steps to narrow the resource protection scope</span>

### Solution 3. Reinforce the base package with full verification selected by default

In this case, only one reinforcement is required. As shown in Figure 5, the game base package is reinforced first and then used to generate channel packages, and no additional special processing needs to be performed on the generated channel packages. After the package stability is checked, the packages can be released normally.

## Do I need to enter the names of all channel packages for the anti-cheat SDK?

The anti-cheat SDK manages the game by channel package, and only channel packages whose name has been entered can be protected by the SDK. You can go to the <a href="#/console/service/overview">**console**</a> to configure or modify channel package names. The package name should be entered as follows:

1. Method 1: enter the complete package name, such as `com.xxx.demo`.
2. Method 2: enter the package name substring such as `xxx` in `com.xxx.demo`. If another channel has the same substring, the package name doesn't need to be entered repeatedly (this feature is supported on SDK v4.5.2 or above).

## Summary

<font color="red">When packaging multiple channel packages, you only need to identify the scenario and select the corresponding solution. </font>As a matter of experience, the most common case is scenario 1 (only resource files in the channel package are modified), and we recommend you use solution 1 (generate channel packages first and then reinforce them). In this case, there may be multiple channel packages that need to be batch reinforced. Scenario 3 also needs to be solved in this way. To improve the efficiency, we recommend you use the command line-based reinforcement tool and write a script by yourself for batch reinforcement.</br>
