## Solution Overview

AssetBundle is a set of resources packaged in a compressed format provided by Unity. It is a mainstream packaging method of Unity game resources. You can use four APIs to load an AssetBundle:
1. AssetBundle.LoadFromMemoryAsync (with high memory usage)
2. AssetBundle.LoadFromFile (recommended by Unity)
3. WWW.LoadfromCacheOrDownload
4. `DownloadHandlerAssetBundle` of `UnityWebRequestAssetBundle` (for Unity 5.3 or above)

Currently, the Unity AssetBundle resource encryption method provided by Shell Service Solution only supports <font color="#dd0000">AssetBundle.LoadFromFile</font>. If you use other APIs for loading, you cannot enable AssetBundle resource encryption, and even if you forcibly enable it, it still won't take effect.

## Directions

### Enablement method

You can use Unity AssetBundle resource encryption in the following steps:

1. Encrypt the `libunity.so` file on the lowest version `3.1.3.65488.global` configured in `tpshell-config.xml` and add `unityfs_filter` to the `<extparams>` tag.
    ```xml
    <TPVersion>3.1.3.65488.global</TPVersion>

    <!--Encryption configuration for Unity AB-->
    <EncSo>libunity.so</EncSo>;
    <extparams>{
    <!--you can add unityfs_filter in <extparams> to enable assetbundle enc-->
    <!--You can add a directory path or file path-->
    "unityfs_filter":["assets/assetbundle", "assets/ab] 
    }
    </extparams>
    ```
2. Add the `-s` parameter to specify the symbol file required by Unity AssetBundle resource file encryption when running the command line-based hardening tool. For more information on the `symbols.zip` file, see the symbol file generation method.
   ```bash
    # How to call the command line-based hardening tool to harden an APK:
    ClientConsole.exe -d <gameId> <apkpath> <outDir> <certPath> -c 
    <configPath> -s <symbolpath>

    # How to call the command line-based hardening tool to harden an AAB:
    ClientConsole.exe -a <gameId> <aabPath> <outDir> <certPath> -c 
    <configPath> -s <symbolpath>
    ```

The command line-based hardening tool supports Unity AssetBundle resource file encryption. For detailed directions, see [Command Line-Based Hardening Tool Operation Guide](#/doc-center/62d03f84c61b92edb63504b4edbf61c705846ed6).

### Disablement method

If the `-s` parameter is deleted when the command line-based hardening tool runs, the Unity AssetBundle resource encryption feature will be disabled by default.

## How to Get Symbol File

Unity AssetBundle resource encryption requires you to provide the symbol file of `libunity`, whose location varies by version.

* **Unity below 2018.1.0f2**

    The symbol file is `nity\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\AndroidPlayer\Variations\il2cpp\Release\Symbols\armeabi-v7a\libunity.sym.so` in the Unity installation path. After finding it, compress the entire `armeabi-v7a` directory into `armeabi-v7a/libunity.sym.so`.

* **Unity 2018.1.0f2 or above**

    Select **Create symbols.zip** when packaging the APK or AAB, and then you can find the symbol package with the same name as the APK and AAB file in the output directory.

## Verification Method

Use a hexadecimal editor to compare the resource files before and after hardening.

Use an extractor to package files before and after encryption. Files can be parsed normally before encryption and fail to be parsed normally after encryption.
