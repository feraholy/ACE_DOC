With the game security protection solution provided by ACE, when using the command line-based reinforcement tool, you must verify that the reinforced game can run normally after the APK or AAB file is reinforced in separate .so file reinforcement mode.

## Precautions

1. The separate .so file reinforcement mode can encrypt certain .so files and is suitable for scenarios such as hot update.
2. The separate .so file reinforcement mode is executed by APK/AAB package, and the input and output content is a complete APK/AAB package. However, the reinforcement process only protects the selected .so files and doesn't modify other files. You need to extract the reinforced target files of the game from the reinforced APK/AAB package and hot update the reinforced target files or perform other subsequent operations on them.

## Tool Description

The reinforcement and signing processes of the command line-based reinforcement tool can be integrated into the CI process, so you can automatically reinforce and sign a game with just one line of code.

**Note:**

1. This tool supports Android games.

2. This tool supports the following operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux (for Windows and Linux, both x86 and x64 tool editions are provided. Please confirm the PC OS configuration first and then select the corresponding tool edition).

3. This tool will authenticate the game first when running. ACE will grant a `.cert` game certificate for each game. If the downloaded tool package doesn't contain the corresponding game certificate, please contact the customer service to get one.

4. This tool provides two reinforcement modes: APK reinforcement mode and App Bundle reinforcement mode.

5. Before calling this tool on macOS or Linux, please grant the corresponding permission to it first by running the following command in its directory:

    ```xml
    cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
    chmod -R 777 ./*
    ```

## APK Reinforcement

**Call method:**

```cmd
cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
MTPClientConsole.exe -d <gameId> <apkpath> <outDir> <certPath> -c <configPath>

**`tpshell-config.xml` configuration file format:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!-- This configuration only configures basic properties -->
<Config>
	<!--Server Tools Version, please use default value and modify it after contacting with customer service-->
	<TPVersion>3.0.0_enc_independent.37082</TPVersion>
    <!--ToolPath: tools location,default ClientConsole/tools or cut this atrribute-->
    <ToolPath>your_tool_absolute_path</ToolPath>
    <!--TPSvrHost: provite server host if you deploy a private svr. Use official host when not set. -->
    <!--TPSvrHost>your_private_svr_host</TPSvrHost-->
    <!-- Sign: information of keystore when using local sign-->
    <Sign>
        <sign-argument name = "keystorePath" value="your_keystore_absolute_path"/>
        <sign-argument name = "keypass" value="123456"/>
        <sign-argument name = "storepass" value="123456"/>
        <sign-argument name = "alianame" value="test"/>
        <!-- This config is obsolete -->
        <!-- <sign-argument name = "v1SigningEnabled" value="true"/>
        <sign-argument name = "v2SigningEnabled" value="false"/>
        <sign-argument name = "v3SigningEnabled" value="false"/> -->
    </Sign>    

    <!-- EncSo: so fileName that you want to encrypt, less than 5 files for performance-->
    <EncSo>libmono.so</EncSo>
    <!-- Encrypt global-metadata requires configuring libil2cpp.so and enable_globalmetadata_enc to true-->
    <EncSo>libil2cpp.so</EncSo>
    <EncSo>libGameCore.so</EncSo>
    <!-- if you want so independent enc,just add: "enc_independent": true to extparams -->
    <extparams>{
        "enable_globalmetadata_enc" : false,
        "enc_independent": true
    }
    </extparams>
</Config>
```

**`tpshell-config` configuration file description:**

Configuration Item | Description
---|---
TPVersion| Reinforcement tool version, which is required
ToolPath| Complete absolute path of the `tools` directory without quotation marks. The operations of the command line-based reinforcement tool depend on the information of the `tools` directory in the tool package
Sign | Signature certificate information, which is optional and provided by the game developer
keystorePath| Absolute path of the key file, which is a string
keyPass| Key library password, which is a string
storePass| Store password, which is a string
aliaName| Alias, which is a string
EncSo| List of names of the .so files to be encrypted without quotation marks. We recommend you select only the .so files of the main game logic. If too many .so files are encrypted, the game performance will be affected
enable_globalmetadata_enc| Whether to enable the `global-metadata.dat` encryption feature. This feature takes effect only if `il2cpp.so` file encryption is enabled. Valid values: `true`, `false`
enc_independent | Whether to enable the separate .so file reinforcement feature. Valid values: `true`, `false`

**Note:**

***Note on `TPVersion`:**
We recommend you use the default version that comes with the command line-based reinforcement tool. If you want to use another version, please contact us.

***Note on the signature:**
If you use a local signature, you don't need to upload the certificate and certificate information; instead, you only need to enter the following signing information: `keystorePath`, `storePass`, `keyPass`, and `aliaName`
The signing method of the APK and App Bundle reinforcement modes keeps the signature versions before and after reinforcement consistent and doesn't require you to configure v1, v2, and v3. If the signing information is unspecified or incorrect, or the package to be reinforced isn't signed, the package will not be signed by default and needs to be manually signed after reinforcement. Generally, .aab packages use only v1 signatures.

***Note on the list of files to be encrypted:**
If `EncSo` is an empty list or not specified, the `libmono.so` and `libil2cpp.so` files will be encrypted by default.

***Note on the separate .so file reinforcement mode:**
The `enc_independent` field is used to enable the separate .so file reinforcement mode and is supported only on reinforcement tool v3.0 or above.

***Note on `global-metadata.dat` encryption:**
The `enable_globalmetadata_enc` field is used to enable `global-metadata` encryption, and you need to configure the `il2cpp.so` file for encryption at the same time. This feature is disabled by default, and its custom configuration is supported only on reinforcement tool v2.6.

***Note on ultra-fast upload:**
The current version of the command line-based reinforcement tool has integrated the ultra-fast upload feature to simplify the network transfer content and improve the transfer speed while eliminating your need to upload a complete package.

## Common Returned Results

Parameter | Description
---|---
The shelling task was finished | The reinforcement task is completed
Shell failed for time out | The reinforcement task failed due to timeout
Configuration error | Configuration parsing error
Command line parameter error| Incorrect command line parameter
Shelling error| Shelling error
Local client error| Local client error
Server error| Server error

## Pseudocode for Batch Operation

**Note**

As shelling involves many I/O operations, taking the server CPU and network bandwidth into consideration, we recommend you enable no more than 10 concurrent threads (which can be adjusted based on the server performance) and use a thread pool to process a large number of installation packages in batches.
