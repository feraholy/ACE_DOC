This document describes how to enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device. Make sure that the game project team has completed the integration of other MTP APIs by following the instructions in "SDK Integration Tutorial_Client_Android_C#" and "SDK Integration Tutorial_Client_Android_C" and "SDK Integration Tutorial_Client_Android_Java".

## Suggestion

1. For privacy compliance,<font color="#dd0000">Based on SDK6.1.7 and above</font>,the security SDK disables the application installation list scanning function on Android devices by default, While improving privacy compliance, the pulg-in detection ability of some functions of the security SDK is reduced。

2. Against this background,The security SDK provides an interface to enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device. The project team with a high risk of plug-in can actively inform the user and declare the permission to obtain the user's application list based on the actual needs. By calling this interface, the SDK's application installation list scanning function is enabled, which greatly improves the SDK's plug-in detection capability.

3. <font color="#dd0000">Due to the compliance upgrade, the Google App Store has strict requirements on collecting the APP installed on the device and declaring the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission. If the project team enables this function, the application may have the risk of not passing the review. Even if the application is approved, it will still be It is possible to be informed of rectification.</font>

## Connection Directions

### Step 1. The following permissions are required:

```xml
<!-- The SDK needs to collect the list of application installed on Android devices, and Android 11 requires 
declaration of the corresponding permission. If `targetSdkVersion` of the application is equal to or above 30, you 
need to add the following permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file; otherwise, the SDK features will be affected: -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES" />
```

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

#### C#

***Function prototype***

```csharp
// `NULL` is not allowed.
string AnoIoctl(string cmd);
```

***Parameter description***

Parameter | Description
-----|----
cmd | "AllowAPKCollect"

For example: To enable application list scanning on Android devices, enter cmd="AllowAPKCollect".

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| AllowAPKCollect | Enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be improved.|

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called.

```csharp
//Enable the collection of the installed applications.
AnoSdk.AnoIoctl("AllowAPKCollect");
```

#### C

***Function prototype***

```cpp
uintptr_t AnoSDKIoctl(int request, const char *param_str);
```

***Parameter description***

Parameter | Description
-----|----
request | The fixed value is AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery.
param | "AllowAPKCollect"

For example: To enable application list scanning on Android devices, enter param="AllowAPKCollect".

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| AllowAPKCollect | Enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be improved.|

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called. In addition, The project team needs to additionally call the 'AnoSDKFree' function to release memory, otherwise there will be memory leaks

```cpp
//Enable the collection of the installed applications.
AnoSdkAntiDataInfo* info = (AnoSdkAntiDataInfo*)AnoSDKIoctl(AnoSdkCmd_CommQuery,"AllowAPKCollect");
AnoSDKFree(info);
```

#### Java

***Function prototype***

```java
// `NULL` is not allowed. 
String ioctl(String cmd);
```

***Parameter description***

Parameter | Description
-----|----
cmd | "AllowAPKCollect"

For example: To enable application list scanning on Android devices, enter cmd="AllowAPKCollect".

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| AllowAPKCollect | Enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be improved.|

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called.

```java
//Enable the collection of the installed applications.
AnoSdk.ioctl("AllowAPKCollect");
```

### Step 3. Enable Function

Enter the ACE console, enable the [Collect Installed Apk List] function on the "Autonomous Policy Management" page, and then click the "Update Now" button;
