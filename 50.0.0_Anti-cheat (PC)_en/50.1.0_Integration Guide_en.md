# Introduction

ACE is a protection system that works on game clients and servers. Game developers need to integrates SDK on both the client and server respectively, and add the specified files to the client's release package and server deployment package, so as to protect the game. This document is a quick start for integration.

Composition of ACE integrated with game:

## Files

This is the directory of ACE SDK :

```
+-- docs                      # documents
+-- projects
|   +-- C++                   # C++ includes and demo
|   +-- C#                    # C# files and demo
|   +-- dist
|   |   +-- AntiCheatExpert   # ACE Main directory
|   |   +-- ACEChecker        # Self-checking tool for integrating
+-- tools
|   +-- AutoProtect           # Basic reinforcement tool
```

Tools of basic reinforcement is located in `tools\AutoProtect`, see `ACE Packing Guide.md`.

**Note:** `AntiCheatExpert\SGuard\x64` directory cannot be deleted if the game is 32-bit.

Tools of basic reinforcement is located in `tools\AutoProtect`, see `ACE Packing Guide.md`.

## Compilation

Add `projects/client/C++/include` to the compiler's include directory, and include the `ace_sdk_client.h` file in the source file that needs to call the SDK interface.

**Note**: If you need to integrate this SDK with the server SDK into the same project (such as in UE4 games) you can delete `ace_sdk_account_busi.h` in this SDK and add `include` to the list of included directories to avoid definition conflicts.

## Quick Integration

The first parameter of this function is `ClientInitInfo`, in which the `first_process_pid` represents the pid of the process first started in this game, and the `current_process_role_id` is a role id of current process (see Client Specification for details. Set to -1 if the game has only one process). The second parameter `path` should be based on the actual path of AntiCheatExpert. Or you can pass nullptr if the AntiCheatExpert directory and the game exe is in the same directory.

```c++
AntiCheatExpert::IAceClient* ace_client = nullptr;
AntiCheatExpert::InitInfo init_info = { static_cast<int>(GetCurrentProcessId()), -1, nullptr };
// the 2nd parameter is the path of ACE-BaseXX.dll, use nullptr if it is in the default path
auto ret = AntiCheatExpert::init_ace_client(&init_info, nullptr, &ace_client);
if (ret != AntiCheatExpert::ACE_OK)
{
    // should exit the game
    std::cout << "Can't load ACE, err:" << (uint32_t)ret << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Call `log_on` right after the user successfully logged on.

```c++
// login phase
auto open_id = get_open_id();

AceAccountInfo acc_info = {};
acc_info.account_id_.account_type_ = ACEACCOUNT_TYPE_COMMON_ID; //we login with common open id
strcpy_s(acc_info.account_id_.account_, open_id.c_str()); //openid
acc_info.plat_id_ = ACEPLAT_ID_PC_CLIENT;
acc_info.game_id_ = 888; //assigned by ACE Team, replace it with your own gameid
acc_info.world_id_ = 0; //world id, if has
acc_info.channel_id_ = 0; //channel id, if has
acc_info.role_id_ = 0; //role id, if has

if (ace_client->log_on(&acc_info, nullptr) != AntiCheatExpert::ACE_OK)
{
    // should exit the game.
    std::cout << "log on failed" << std::endl;
}
```

Call `tick` in the main loop of the game.

```c++
ace_client->tick();
```

Call `log_off` and `exit_process` when user logged off and the game process is exiting.

```cpp
// after user logging off
ace_client->log_off();

// before exiting the process
ace_client->exit_process();
```

## Integration Test

After integration, copy the `dist/AntiCheatExpert` and `dist/ACEChecker` directories to the same directory of game executable. While starting the game, the SDK opens an `ACE Checker` html page to show the result of the auto integration test.

::: important
Directory ACEChecker is only for testing purpose, and MUST NOT be published. Yet, please do not leak the files in it.
:::

::: important
The game process will not be abled to debug after integration and the AntiCheatExpert placed correctly. You may temporarily turn off SDK loading to debug the game.
:::

![The ACE Checker Page](/docs/ACE-doc/50_anti-cheat-pc/10/checker_page.png)

`Basic Info` Page in left column show the basic information of the game. Click `SDK Results`  to check the SDK integration result.

Please use this page to check the result after starting the game, logging on, and exiting the game.

## Publish

You may use the basic reinforcement services provided by ACE according to needs, while additional `GameBase.dll` file will be generated after reinforcement.

When the game client is releasing, put the `AntiCheatExpert` directory in the same directory as the game exe (or any other directory according to your needs, but keeps the directory structure inside the `AntiCheatExpert` unchanged), and specify the path when the SDK is initialized.

The default directory tree is:

```
+-- Game.exe			# The first exe of the game
+-- GameBase.dll        # if uses basic reinforcement service
+-- AntiCheatExpert
|   +-- InGame
|   ...
|   +-- SGuard
|   ...
```
