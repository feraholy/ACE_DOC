## Overview

The PC game anti-cheat solution is a protective system running on game clients and servers. To protect your game with this solution, you need to connect to the corresponding SDKs on your game client and server and add the specified files to your client release package and server deployment package respectively. This document describes how to quickly connect the game client to the solution. After connection, the game client architecture is as shown below:

## SDK Directory

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/50_anti-cheat-pc/10/5.png)

## Compilation

Add `projects/client/include` to the compiler's `include` directories and include the `ace_sdk_client.h` file in the source files that need to call the SDK APIs.

<font color="#dd0000">Note: if you want to integrate this SDK and the server SDK into the same project (e.g., in a UE4 game), to avoid definition conflicts, you can delete `client/include/ace_sdk_account_busi.h` from this SDK and add the `include` directory in the server SDK to the `include` directory list.</font>

## Quick SDK Integration

* During game initialization, call `init_ace_client` as soon as possible for initialization.

``` c++
AntiCheatExpert::IAceClient* ace_client = nullptr; 
AntiCheatExpert::InitInfo init_info = { static_cast(GetCurrentProcessId()), -1 }; 
// the 2nd parameter is the path of ACE-BaseXX.dll, use nullptr if it is in the default path 
auto ret = AntiCheatExpert::init_ace_client(&init_info, nullptr, &ace_client); 
if (ret != AntiCheatExpert::ACE_OK) 
{ 
    // should exit the game 
    std::cout << "Can't load ACE, err:" << (uint32_t)ret << std::endl; 
    return 0; 
}
```

This function's first parameter is `InitInfo`, and you need to enter the `pid` of the .exe file directly started by ACE-Launcher during the game start and the process role ID (for a single-process game, simply enter `-1`). For more information, please see the specification description document which you can get from the <a href="https://admin.qidian.qq.com/template/blue/mp/menu/qr-code-jump.html?linkType=0&env=ol&kfuin=2852167644&fid=28&key=d81ab0145faf07ade8b35f63efae4464&cate=1&type=16&ftype=1&_type=wpa&qidian=true" target="_blank">customer service</a>.

The path entered in the second parameter must be the actual path of `AntiCheatExpert`. If you use the default path configuration (i.e., the `AntiCheatExpert` directory and the game .exe file are in the same directory), you only need to pass in `nullptr`.

* The `log_on` API needs to be called immediately after successful user login.

```c++
AceAccountInfo acc_info = {}; 
//we login with WeChat 
acc_info.account_id_.account_type_ = ACEACCOUNT_TYPE_WECHAT; 
//openid 
strcpy_s(acc_info.account_id_.account_, "xxxxxxxxxxx"); 
acc_info.plat_id_ = ACEPLAT_ID_PC_CLIENT; 
//assigned by ACE Team, replace it with your own gameid 
acc_info.game_id_ = 888; 
//world id, if has 
acc_info.world_id_ = 0; 
//channel id, if has 
acc_info.channel_id_ = 0; 
//role id, if has 
acc_info.role_id_ = 0; 

if (ace_client->log_on(&amp;acc_info) != AntiCheatExpert::ACE_OK) 
{ 
// should exit the game. 
std::cout << "log on failed" << std::endl; 
} 
```

* Call the `tick` API in the main rendering loop of the game.

```c++
ace_client->tick();
```

* Call the `log_off` and `exit_process` APIs during user logout and process exit respectively.

```c++
// after user logging off
ace_client->log_off();
 
// before exiting the process
ace_client->exit_process();
```

* For more information on the usage of some APIs of the optional Antibot channel, please see the documentation for connection to optional channels of the demo and client SDK, which can be obtained from the <a href="https://admin.qidian.qq.com/template/blue/mp/menu/qr-code-jump.html?linkType=0&env=ol&kfuin=2852167644&fid=28&key=d81ab0145faf07ade8b35f63efae4464&cate=1&type=16&ftype=1&_type=wpa&qidian=true" target="_blank">customer service</a>.

## Integration Test

After the APIs are connected, copy the `AntiCheatExpert` directory to the directory of the .exe file to be tested (or the directory you specified during integration). Then, run the .exe, or use the .exe generated in `demo/cpp_client` for test. Generated logs will be saved in the same directory of `ACE-Base64/32.dll`.

You can send the log files to ACE for inspection or check them on your own. In the latter case, you need to check whether the following log information exists:

| API Description | Log Information |
|------|------|
| Initialization |[AntiCheatExpert::AceClient::make_instance]AceClient Init success |
| Account configuration |[AntiCheatExpert::AceClient::log_on]account_info: acc: .. |
| Ticking |[AntiCheatExpert::AceClient::tick]ticking. This log displays only the first 10 ticks |
| Process logout |[AntiCheatExpert::AceClient::log_off]user logging off |
| Process exit |[AntiCheatExpert::AceClient::exit_process]user exiting process |

For more information on the logs of the Antibot channel, please see the development guide, which can be obtained from the <a href="https://admin.qidian.qq.com/template/blue/mp/menu/qr-code-jump.html?linkType=0&env=ol&kfuin=2852167644&fid=28&key=d81ab0145faf07ade8b35f63efae4464&cate=1&type=16&ftype=1&_type=wpa&qidian=true" target="_blank">customer service</a>.

## Release and Deployment

You can connect to the provided basic reinforcement service as needed. After reinforcement, an additional `GameBase.dll` file will be generated.
When releasing the client, place `ACE-Launcher32/64.exe` and the `AntiCheatExpert` directory in the same directory of the game .exe file (you can also place them into any directory specified by the publisher) and specify the path during SDK initialization.

The default directory structure is as shown below:
