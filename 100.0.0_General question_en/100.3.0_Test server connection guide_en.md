## Steps to Connect to Test Server for Android

1. Connect an Android phone to PC through a USB cable, enter the adb shell mode, and check whether the `/sdcard/sdk` directory exists, and if not, type `mkdir /sdcard/sdk` in the adb shell.
2. Place the `enable.log` file in `/sdcard/sdk/` on the phone.
3. Make sure that the storage permission of the app has been granted.
4. Logs generated by the SDK are output to the `sdcard/sdk/log.log` file. Check whether the download link of `config2.xml` in `log.log` contains `test`, and if so, the connection is successful.

Note: you can contact the customer service to get the `enable.log` file.

(Note: after the test is completed, if the game does not require the file sharing feature, you need to delete the key-value pair; otherwise, the game may not be approved by App Store.)
2. Place the `enable.log` file in the `Documents` directory of the game on the phone. Generally, you can use iExplorer or iTools to access the `Documents` directory of the app.

3. Logs generated by the SDK are output to the `log_XAYY.log` file in the same directory as `enable.log`.
4. Check whether the download link of `config2.xml` in `log_XAYY.log` contains `test`, and if so, the connection is successful.

Note: you can contact the customer service to get the `enable.log` file.
