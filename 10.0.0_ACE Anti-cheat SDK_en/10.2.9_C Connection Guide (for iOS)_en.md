## Precautions for Connection

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
```

## Overview

* We recommend you connect the game's library file as a dynamic library for the following benefits:

```xml
1. Smaller size: the size of a dynamic library file is much smaller than that of a static library, so you can reduce the size of the final package file.
2. Reduced symbol exposure: the internal symbols of a dynamic library aren't exposed, so you can minimize the possibility of symbol conflicts between the SDK and the game code.
3. Easier update: when updating the game project, you only need to replace `tersafe2.framework` instead of compiling the entire project again.
```

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required for connecting an iOS game to the SDK:

```xml
tersafe2.framework
```

* The following permissions are required:

```xml
Internet Access
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: tp2_sdk_init_ex
2. User login API: tp2_setuserinfo
3. Foreground/Background switch API: tp2_setgamestatus
```

* Notes:

```xml
1. The original initialization API `tp2_sdk_init` of the SDK has been disused and replaced with `tp2_sdk_init_ex` with the `app_key` parameter added.
```

## Integration Steps

### Step 1. Add SDK files to the project

1. Copy the `tersafe2.framework` package to any directory under the iOS project directory.
2. In **Build Phases** > **Link Binary With Libraries**, add reference to `tersafe2.framework`.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_001.jpg)
   Note: `tersafe2.framework` should be in a parallel rather than dependent relationship with other dynamic libraries (including `UnityFramework.framework`).
3. In **Build Setting** > **Search Paths** > **Library Search Paths**, add the directory where `tersafe2.framework` is.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_002.jpg)
4. In **General** > **Embedded Binaries**, add the option of `tersafe2.framework`.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_001.png)
5. You can switch to **Build Phases** > **Embed Frameworks** to confirm that the **Destination** for adding `tersafe2.framework` is **Frameworks** and **Code Sign On Copy** is selected.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_002.png)
6. Set `iOS Deployment Target` to `iOS 8.0` (as only iOS 8.0 or above supports dynamic libraries).
   In Xcode, switch to **Build Settings** to search for **iOS Deployment Target** and set it.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/u70.png)

### Project attribute settings

1. The SDK doesn't support bitcode; therefore, you need to disable bitcode in Xcode during compilation as shown below:
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_02.png)
2. Configure compilation options (symbol removal settings).
3. You can remove the debug symbols from the program to make reverse engineering more difficult and increase the program's code security. To implement this, simply complete the following settings and recompile the game in Xcode:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_03.png)

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Header file**

```c++
#include "tersafe2/tp2_sdk.h"
```

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
int tp2_sdk_init_ex(int game_id, const char* app_key);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--- | -- | --|
|game_id | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|app_key | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_Anti-cheat%20SDK/30/clipboard_20220126_042604.png)

* **User login API**

```c++
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
int tp2_setuserinfo(int account_type, int world_id,
const char *open_id, const char *role_id);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|-----|
|account_type | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `TssSdkEntryId` below |
|world_id | Region information of the user's game character |
|open_id | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string. It is required if punishment is involved |
|role_id | ID of the character created by the user |

For `account_type`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```c++
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
enum TssSdkEntryId{
    ENTRY_ID_QZONE = 1,   // QQ
    ENTRY_ID_MM  = 2,  // WeChat
    ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK  = 3,  // Facebook
    ENTRY_ID_TWITTER  = 4,  // Twitter
    ENTRY_ID_LINE  = 5,  // Line
    ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP  = 6,  // WhatsApp
    ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7, // Game Center
    ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8, // Google Play
    ENTRY_ID_VK = 9, // VK
    ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU = 10, // Kuaishou
    ENTRY_ID_APPLE = 11, // Apple
    ENTRY_ID_OTHERS  = 99,  // Other platforms
}
```

`world_id` is customized by the game. If the game has only one region, you can enter `0`.

`role_id` is used to distinguish between different characters of the same account in the same region. If there is only one character, you can enter "" (null).

`open_id` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

* **Foreground/Background switch API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
int tp2_setgamestatus (int status);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|--- | ---|
|status | Foreground: TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND; background: TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND|

```c++
enum TP2GameStatus{
    TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND = 1,    // Foreground
    TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND = 2,    // Background
}
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`tp2_sdk_init_ex` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `app_key`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`tp2_setuserinfo` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `tp2_setuserinfo` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.

`tp2_setgamestatus` should be called when the game is switched to the foreground/background.
When switching the game from the background to the foreground, call the `tp2_setgamestatus` API and set the parameter to `TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND`.
When switching the game from the foreground to the background, pass in the `TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND` parameter value.
Some features of the SDK will stop running if the game is switched to the background. Therefore, this API will affect the normal operations of SDK features.
```

```c++
void game_start() {
    // It is first called when the game is started
    tp2_sdk_init_ex (9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");

    // It is called when the user logs in
    int account_type = ENTRY_ID_QZONE;  /*Account type*/
    int world_id = 101;  /*Region ID*/
    char open_id[] = "B73B36366565F9E02C752";/*User ID related to the platform*/
    char role_id[] = "paladin"; /*Character ID*/
    tp2_setuserinfo(account_type, world_id, open_id, role_id);
};

// Switch the game to the background
int game_pause(){
    return tp2_setgamestatus(TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND);
}

// Switch the game to the foreground
int game_resume(){
    return tp2_setgamestatus(TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND);
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. Make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game client has been connected to the iOS broadcasting API.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

1. Use jailbreak to check whether the features of forced quit , Go to the [data query](#/console/service/query-data) page to check whether the relevant cheating information is displayed (note: there is a 5-minute delay for data display).

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/inner_csharp_11.png)

## Data Privacy Compliance APIs

**Though cheats are less likely to happen in some games, they can be exposed to data privacy compliance risks arising from the SDK. Using data privacy compliance APIs in SDK 5.9.20 and above, you can disable anti-cheat data collection and anti-cheat of the SDK, reducing data collection and improving data privacy compliance.**

#### (Optional) Disabling data collection for Android devices with the API

The API is provided to configure the SDK to not collect data you want to protect from the Android device. You can call the API as needed.

The SDK can be configured to not collect the following information: the device screen resolution, SD card path, files path in the SD card, CPU name, application debugging status, application certificate, certificate author, certificate environment, CPU model, device manufacturer, device model, and VPN status.

***Function prototype***

```cpp
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) uintptr_t tp2_sdk_ioctl(int request, const
char *param_str);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|request | The fixed value is `TssSDKCmd_CommQuery`.|
|param | Specifies what information will not be collected. `NULL` is not allowed.|

The values of `param` are shown in the table below. To not collect the information you want to protect, you can perform the bitwise OR operation (|) on the corresponding parameter value to calculate a hex integer, and pass the value formatted in "CloseDevInfoCollect: 0x%x" to `param`.

For example: To not collect all information, enter cmd="CloseDevInfoCollect:0xfff". To not collect the screen resolution, manufacturer, and model of the device, then enter cmd="CloseDevInfoCollect:0x601".

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ---- | ----- | -----|
| 0x00000001 | Screen resolution of the device | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000002 | Path of the SD card | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000004 | Files path in the SD card | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000008 | CPU name | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000010 | Debugging status of the application | The SDK capability to detect debuggers such as IDA will be reduced. |
| 0x00000020 | Certificate of the application | The SDK will fail to detect the cracked versions. |
| 0x00000040 | Author of the application’s certificate | The SDK will fail to detect the cracked versions. |
| 0x00000080 | Environment of the application’s certificate | The SDK capability to detect the cracked versions will be reduced. |
| 0x00000100 | CPU model | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000200 | Manufacturer of the device | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000400 | Device model | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000800 | VPN status | The SDK capability to detect the suspicious network will be reduced. |

***When to call the function***

Make an API call right after the SDK initialization API is called. The call can also be made before players log in.

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    // Disable the collection of all information.
     tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseDevInfoCollect:0xfff");
     // Disable the collection of the screen resolution, manufacturer, and model of the device.
     tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseDevInfoCollect:0x601");
      // Disable the collection of the CPU name, certificate of the application and CPU model.
    tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseDevInfoCollect:0x128");
}
```

#### (Optional) Disabling specific scanning with the API

The API is provided to configure the SDK to not collect data from specific scanning. When cheats are less likely to happen in the game application, you can call the API as needed.

The SDK can be configured to disable scanning of the following items: the installed applications (Android), device environment (Android + iOS), emulator (Android + iOS), resource profiler (Android), and cloud phone (Android + iOS).

***Function prototype***

```cpp
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) uintptr_t tp2_sdk_ioctl(int request, const
char *param_str);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|request | The fixed value is `TssSDKCmd_CommQuery`.|
|param | Specifies the SDK scanning feature to be disabled. `NULL` is not allowed.|

The values of `param` are shown in the table below.

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| CloseAPKCollect | Scans the applications installed on the Android device. | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be reduced. |
| CloseUserTagScan | Scans the device environment. | After it is disabled, the device environment of the SDK cannot be detected, such as whether it is rooted or jailbroken. |
| CloseEmulatorScan | Scans the emulator environment. | The SDK capability to scan the emulator will be disabled. |
| CloseAntiProfiler | Disables defense capabilities of the resource profiler. | The SDK capability to detect and protect the resource profiler will be disabled. |
| CloseCloudPhoneScan | Scans the cloud phone environment. | The SDK capability to detect the cloud phone will be disabled. |

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called.

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    //Disable the collection of the installed applications.
     tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseAPKCollect");
    //Disable the collection of the device environment.
    tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseUserTagScan");
     //Disable the scanning of the emulator.
     tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseEmulatorScan");
     //Disable the defense capabilities of the resource profiler.
     tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseAntiProfiler");
    //Disable the scanning of the cloud phone.
    tp2_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseCloudPhoneScan");
}
```
