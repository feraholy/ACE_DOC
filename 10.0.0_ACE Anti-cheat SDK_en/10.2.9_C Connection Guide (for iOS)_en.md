## Precautions for Connection

<font color="red">The access tutorial only supports SDK version 6.1.11 and above.</font>

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
```

## Overview

* We recommend you connect the game's library file as a dynamic library for the following benefits:

```xml
1. Smaller size: the size of a dynamic library file is much smaller than that of a static library, so you can reduce the size of the final package file.
2. Reduced symbol exposure: the internal symbols of a dynamic library aren't exposed, so you can minimize the possibility of symbol conflicts between the SDK and the game code.
3. Easier update: when updating the game project, you only need to replace `anogs.framework` instead of compiling the entire project again.
```

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required for connecting an iOS game to the SDK:

```xml
anogs.framework
```

* The following permissions are required:

```xml
Internet Access
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: AnoSDKInitEx
2. User login API: AnoSDKSetUserInfo
3. API for switching from foreground to background: AnoSDKOnPause
4. API for switching from background to foreground: AnoSDKOnResume
```

## Integration Steps

### Step 1. Add SDK files to the project

1. Copy the `anogs.framework` package to any directory under the iOS project directory.
2. In **Build Phases** > **Link Binary With Libraries**, add reference to `anogs.framework`.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_004.png)
   Note: `anogs.framework` should be in a parallel rather than dependent relationship with other dynamic libraries (including `UnityFramework.framework`).
3. In **Build Setting** > **Search Paths** > **Library Search Paths**, add the directory where `anogs.framework` is.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_005.png)
4. In **General** > **Embedded Binaries**, add the option of `anogs.framework`.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_006.png)
5. You can switch to **Build Phases** > **Embed Frameworks** to confirm that the **Destination** for adding `anogs.framework` is **Frameworks** and **Code Sign On Copy** is selected.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_007.png)
6. Set `iOS Deployment Target` to `iOS 8.0` (as only iOS 8.0 or above supports dynamic libraries).
   In Xcode, switch to **Build Settings** to search for **iOS Deployment Target** and set it.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_008.png)

### Project attribute settings

1. The SDK doesn't support bitcode; therefore, you need to disable bitcode in Xcode during compilation as shown below:
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_02.png)
2. Configure compilation options (symbol removal settings).
3. You can remove the debug symbols from the program to make reverse engineering more difficult and increase the program's code security. To implement this, simply complete the following settings and recompile the game in Xcode:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_03.png)

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Header file**

```c++
#include "ano_sdk.h"
```

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
void AnoSDKInitEx(int game_id, const char* app_key);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--- | -- | --|
|game_id | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|app_key | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_Anti-cheat%20SDK/30/clipboard_20220126_042604.png)

* **User login API**

```c++
void AnoSDKSetUserInfo(int account_type,const char *open_id);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|-----|
|account_type | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `AnoSdkEntryId` below |
|open_id | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string. It is required if punishment is involved |

For `account_type`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```c++
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
enum AnoSdkEntryId{
	ENTRY_ID_QZONE		= 1,       	// QQ
	ENTRY_ID_MM			= 2,       	// wechat
	ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK	= 3,		// facebook
	ENTRY_ID_TWITTER	= 4,		// twitter
	ENTRY_ID_LINE		= 5,		// line
	ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP	= 6,		// whatsapp
	ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7,		// gamecenter
	ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8,		// googleplay
	ENTRY_ID_VK         = 9,		// vk
	ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU	= 10,		// kuaishou
	ENTRY_ID_APPLE		= 11,		// apple
	ENTRY_ID_NEXON		= 12,		// nexon
	ENTRY_ID_NAVER		= 13,		// naver
    ENTRY_ID_GARENA		= 14,		// garena
	ENTRY_ID_HUAWEI		= 15,		// huawei
	ENTRY_ID_RIOT       = 16,       // riot
	ENTRY_ID_NINTENDO   = 17,       // nintendo
	ENTRY_ID_PSN        = 18,       // psn
	ENTRY_ID_MICROSOFT  = 19,       // microsoft
	ENTRY_ID_EA         = 20,       // ea
	ENTRY_ID_CUSTOM     = 21,       // custom
	ENTRY_ID_OTHERS		= 99,		// other platform
}
```

`open_id` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

* **API for switching from foreground to background**

**Function prototype**

```c++
/**
If the program is switched from the foreground to the background, the game is in inactive status.
*/
void AnoSDKOnPause();
```

* **API for switching from background to foreground**

**Function prototype**

```c++
/**
If the program is switched from the background to the foreground, the game is in active status.
*/
void AnoSDKOnResume();
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`AnoSDKInitEx` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `app_key`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`AnoSDKSetUserInfo` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `AnoSDKSetUserInfo` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.

`AnoSDKOnResume` should be called when the game is switched from the background to the foreground.

`AnoSDKOnPause` should be called when the game is switched from the foreground to the background.

Some features of the SDK will stop running if the game is switched to the background. Therefore, this API will affect the normal operations of SDK features.
```

```c++
void game_start() {
    // It is first called when the game is started
    AnoSDKInitEx (9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");

    // It is called when the user logs in
    int account_type = ENTRY_ID_QZONE;  /*Account type*/
    char open_id[] = "B73B36366565F9E02C752";/*User ID related to the platform*/
    AnoSDKSetUserInfo(account_type, open_id);
};

// Switch the game to the background
void game_pause(){
    AnoSDKOnPause();
}

// Switch the game to the foreground
void game_resume(){
     AnoSDKOnResume();
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. Make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game client has been connected to the iOS broadcasting API.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

1. Use jailbreak to check whether the features of forced quit , Go to the [data query](#/console/service/query-data) page to check whether the relevant cheating information is displayed (note: there is a 5-minute delay for data display).

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/inner_csharp_11.png)

## Data Privacy Compliance APIs

**Though cheats are less likely to happen in some games, they can be exposed to data privacy compliance risks arising from the SDK. Using data privacy compliance APIs in SDK 5.9.20 and above, you can disable anti-cheat data collection and anti-cheat of the SDK, reducing data collection and improving data privacy compliance.**

#### (Optional) Disabling specific scanning with the API

The API is provided to configure the SDK to not collect data from specific scanning. When cheats are less likely to happen in the game application, you can call the API as needed.

The SDK can be configured to disable scanning of the following items: the installed applications (Android), device environment (Android + iOS), emulator (Android + iOS), resource profiler (Android), and cloud phone (Android + iOS).

***Function prototype***

```cpp
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) uintptr_t AnoSDKIoctl(int request, const
char *param_str);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|request | The fixed value is `TssSDKCmd_CommQuery`.|
|param | Specifies the SDK scanning feature to be disabled. `NULL` is not allowed.|

The values of `param` are shown in the table below.

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| CloseAPKCollect | Scans the applications installed on the Android device. | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be reduced. |
| CloseUserTagScan | Scans the device environment. | After it is disabled, the device environment of the SDK cannot be detected, such as whether it is rooted or jailbroken. |
| CloseEmulatorScan | Scans the emulator environment. | The SDK capability to scan the emulator will be disabled. |
| CloseAntiProfiler | Disables defense capabilities of the resource profiler. | The SDK capability to detect and protect the resource profiler will be disabled. |
| CloseCloudPhoneScan | Scans the cloud phone environment. | The SDK capability to detect the cloud phone will be disabled. |

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called.

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    //Disable the collection of the installed applications.
     AnoSDKIoctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseAPKCollect");
    //Disable the collection of the device environment.
    AnoSDKIoctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseUserTagScan");
     //Disable the scanning of the emulator.
     AnoSDKIoctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseEmulatorScan");
     //Disable the defense capabilities of the resource profiler.
     AnoSDKIoctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseAntiProfiler");
    //Disable the scanning of the cloud phone.
    AnoSDKIoctl(TssSDKCmd_CommQuery,"CloseCloudPhoneScan");
}
```
