* If your game has a global edition, please <font color="blue"> [contact the customer service] </font> to get the guide on how to connect global game domain names and IPs to Anti-cheat SDK. (<font color="#dd0000">Anti-cheat SDK collects necessary user data to detect cheat behaviors. Please read the information in the data collection form in the SDK package carefully before connecting to and using the SDK.</font>)

## Precautions for Connection

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. We recommend you connect your game to both Anti-cheat SDK and broadcasting API to better combat cheats.
5. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
6. In order for Anti-cheat SDK to effectively defend against cheats, the Anti-cheat service must be within the validity period, and you must add the project package name of the game through the channel information in game management in the console.
```

## Overview

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the game ID and user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required during connection to the SDK for C#:

```xml
tp2.cs
tp2.jar (Android)
libtersafe2.so (Android)
tersafe2.framework (iOS dynamic library)
```

* The following permissions are required:

For Android:

```xml
<!-- The SDK needs to collect the list of application installed on Android devices, and Android 11 requires declaration of the corresponding permission. If `targetSdkVersion` of the application is equal to or above 30, you need to add the following permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file; otherwise, the SDK features will be affected: -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES" />
<!-- Optional permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

For iOS:

```xml
Internet Access
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: Tp2SdkInitEx
2. User login API: Tp2UserLogin
3. Foreground/Background switch API: Tp2SetGamestatus
```

* Notes:

```xml
1. The original initialization API `Tp2SdkInit` of the SDK has been disused and replaced with `Tp2SdkInitEx` with the `appKey` parameter added.
2. We recommend you connect the game's library file as a dynamic library on iOS.
```

* Additional information (benefits of connection as dynamic library on iOS):

```xml
1. Smaller size: the size of a dynamic library file is much smaller than that of a static library, so you can reduce the size of the final package file.
2. Reduced symbol exposure: the internal symbols of a dynamic library aren't exposed, so you can minimize the possibility of symbol conflicts between the SDK and the game code.
3. Easier update: when updating the SDK, you only need to replace `tersafe.framework` in the game project instead of compiling the entire project again.
```

## Connection Directions

### Step 1. Add SDK dependencies in the project configuration

#### Android

1. Copy **tp2.cs** in the `sdk\android\c#` directory to the `Assets` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_01.jpg)
2. Copy **tp2.jar** in the `sdk\android\c#` directory to the `Assets\Plugins\Android` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_02.jpg)

**Multiple CPU architectures**

If your game supports multiple Android CPU architectures (currently, Unity supports armeabi-v7a, x86, armeabi, arm64-v8a, and x86_64), then copy the `libtersafe2.so` files in the folders named after the CPU architectures in the `sdk\android\c#\lib` directory to the following directories respectively:

```file
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/armeabi-v7a/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/x86/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/armeabi/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/arm64-v8a/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/x86_64/
```

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_03.png)

**Single CPU architecture**

If your game supports only arm-v7, taking Unity 4.5 as an example, simply copy the `tp2.jar` file and the `libtersafe2.so` file in the `armeabi-v7a` directory provided by the SDK to the `_Assets_Plugins_Android_` directory.

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_05.jpg)

**Project attribute settings**

If your game supports multiple CPU architectures, select **File** > **Build Settings** > **Player Settings** > **Other Settings** > **Device Filter** > **FAT(ARMv7+x86)**.

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_04.jpg)

#### iOS

1. Copy **tp2.cs** in the `sdk\iOS\c#` directory to the `Assets` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922191034845.png )
2. Copy **tersafe2.framework** in the `sdk\iOS\c#` directory to the `Assets\Plugins\iOS` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922175656315.png )
3. Set the configuration attributes of **tersafe2.framework** in Unity and select **Add to Embedded Binaries** (this is optional in Unity below version 2018.3).
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922190959481.png )
4. Export the project as an Xcode project and modify the attributes dependent on `tersafe2.framework` in the main game target to **Embed & Sign**:
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922191833270.png )
5. The SDK doesn't support bitcode; therefore, you need to disable bitcode in Xcode during compilation as shown below:
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_02.png)

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```csharp
void Tp2SdkInitEx (int gameId, string appKey );
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--- | --- | ---|
|gameId | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|appKey | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_Anti-cheat%20SDK/30/clipboard_20220126_042604.png)

* **User login API**

**Function prototype**

```csharp
void Tp2UserLogin (int account_type, int world_id, string open_id, string role_id);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|account_type | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `Tp2Entry` below |
|world_id | Region information of the user's game character |
|open_id | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string and cannot contain special symbols. It is required if punishment is involved |
|role_id | ID of the character created by the user |

For `account_type`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```csharp
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
public enum Tp2Entry{
    ENTRY_ID_QZONE = 1,   // QQ
    ENTRY_ID_MM  = 2,  // WeChat
    ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK  = 3,  // Facebook
    ENTRY_ID_TWITTER  = 4,  // Twitter
    ENTRY_ID_LINE  = 5,  // Line
    ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP  = 6,  // WhatsApp
    ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7, // Game Center
    ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8, // Google Play
    ENTRY_ID_VK = 9, // VK
    ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU = 10, // Kuaishou
    ENTRY_ID_APPLE = 11, // Apple
    ENTRY_ID_OTHERS  = 99,  // Other platforms
};
```

`world_id` is customized by the game. If the game has only one region, you can enter `0`.

`open_id` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

`role_id` is used to distinguish between different characters of the same account in the same region. If there is only one character, you can enter "" (null).

* **Foreground/Background switch API**

**Function prototype**

```csharp
void Tp2SetGamestatus(Tp2GameStatus status);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|--- | ---|
|status | Foreground: Tp2GameStatus.FRONTEND; background: Tp2GameStatus.BACKEND|

```csharp
public enum Tp2GameStatus{

    FRONTEND  = 1, // Foreground
    BACKEND  = 2,  // Background
}
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`Tp2SdkInitEx` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `appKey`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`Tp2UserLogin` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `Tp2UserLogin` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.

`Tp2SetGamestatus` should be called when the game is switched to the foreground/background.
When switching the game from the background to the foreground, call the `Tp2SetGamestatus` API and set the parameter to `Tp2GameStatus.FRONTEND`.
When switching the game from the foreground to the background, pass in the `Tp2GameStatus.BACKEND` parameter value.
Some features of the SDK will stop running if the game is switched to the background. Therefore, this API will affect the normal operations of SDK features.
```

```csharp
private void Awake () {

    // It is first called when the game is started
    Tp2Sdk.Tp2SdkInitEx(9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");
}

private void Start () {
    int account_type = (int)Tp2Entry.ENTRY_ID_QZONE; /*Account type related to the operations platform*/
    int world_id = 101;  /*Region information of the user's game character*/
    string open_id = "B73B36366565F9E02C7525516DCF31 C2"; /*Account ID related to the login platform*/
    string role_id = "paladin"; /*ID of the character created by the user*/
    Tp2Sdk.Tp2UserLogin(account_type, world_id, open_id, role_id);
}

// It is called when the game is switched to the foreground/background
void OnApplicationPause (bool pause) {
    if (pause) {
        Tp2Sdk.Tp2SetGamestatus (Tp2GameStatus.BACKEND);
    } else {
        Tp2Sdk.Tp2SetGamestatus (Tp2GameStatus.FRONTEND);
    }
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

For Android:

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. To combat cheats, make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game package name has been added to the Android channel information in service management.
3. Check whether the feature of forced quit based on either-or can be normally used.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

1. Use a cheat to check whether the features of forced quit for trainers, speed adjusters, and VMs and either-or work. For the specific effect of cheat defense, please watch [this video](https://v.qq.com/x/page/y0868v09qgj.html) (note: to get the sample cheats used in the video, please contact the customer service).
2. Go to the [data query](#/console/service/query-data) page to check whether the relevant cheating information is displayed (note: there is a 5-minute delay for data display).

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_Anti-cheat%20SDK/30/clipboard_20220126_042837.png)

For iOS:

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. Make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game package name has been added to the iOS channel information in ACE.
3. Check whether the game client has been connected to the iOS broadcasting API.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

In 30–60 seconds after the SDK is started, check whether the following data is printed in the string data returned by the client broadcasting API; and if so, the SDK is properly started.
