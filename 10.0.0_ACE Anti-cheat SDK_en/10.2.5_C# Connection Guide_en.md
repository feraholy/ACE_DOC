## Precautions for Connection

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
```

## Overview

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the game ID and user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required during connection to the SDK for C#:

```xml
tp2.cs
tp2.jar (Android)
libtersafe2.so (Android)
tersafe2.framework (iOS dynamic library)
```

* The following permissions are required:

For Android:

```xml
<!-- The SDK needs to collect the list of application installed on Android devices, and Android 11 requires declaration of the corresponding permission. If `targetSdkVersion` of the application is equal to or above 30, you need to add the following permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file; otherwise, the SDK features will be affected: -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES" />
<!-- Optional permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

For iOS:

```xml
Internet Access
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: Tp2SdkInitEx
2. User login API: Tp2UserLogin
3. Foreground/Background switch API: Tp2SetGamestatus
```

* Notes:

```xml
1. The original initialization API `Tp2SdkInit` of the SDK has been disused and replaced with `Tp2SdkInitEx` with the `appKey` parameter added.
2. We recommend you connect the game's library file as a dynamic library on iOS.
```

* Additional information (benefits of connection as dynamic library on iOS):

```xml
1. Smaller size: the size of a dynamic library file is much smaller than that of a static library, so you can reduce the size of the final package file.
2. Reduced symbol exposure: the internal symbols of a dynamic library aren't exposed, so you can minimize the possibility of symbol conflicts between the SDK and the game code.
3. Easier update: when updating the SDK, you only need to replace `tersafe.framework` in the game project instead of compiling the entire project again.
```

## Connection Directions

### Step 1. Add SDK dependencies in the project configuration

#### Android

1. Copy **tp2.cs** in the `sdk\android\c#` directory to the `Assets` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_01.jpg)
2. Copy **tp2.jar** in the `sdk\android\c#` directory to the `Assets\Plugins\Android` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_02.jpg)

**Multiple CPU architectures**

If your game supports multiple Android CPU architectures (currently, Unity supports armeabi-v7a, x86, armeabi, arm64-v8a, and x86_64), then copy the `libtersafe2.so` files in the folders named after the CPU architectures in the `sdk\android\c#\lib` directory to the following directories respectively:

```file
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/armeabi-v7a/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/x86/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/armeabi/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/arm64-v8a/
Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/x86_64/
```

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_03.png)

**Single CPU architecture**

If your game supports only arm-v7, taking Unity 4.5 as an example, simply copy the `tp2.jar` file and the `libtersafe2.so` file in the `armeabi-v7a` directory provided by the SDK to the `_Assets_Plugins_Android_` directory.

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_05.jpg)

**Project attribute settings**

If your game supports multiple CPU architectures, select **File** > **Build Settings** > **Player Settings** > **Other Settings** > **Device Filter** > **FAT(ARMv7+x86)**.

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_C_04.jpg)

#### iOS

1. Copy **tp2.cs** in the `sdk\iOS\c#` directory to the `Assets` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922191034845.png )
2. Copy **tersafe2.framework** in the `sdk\iOS\c#` directory to the `Assets\Plugins\iOS` directory of the project.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922175656315.png )
3. Set the configuration attributes of **tersafe2.framework** in Unity and select **Add to Embedded Binaries** (this is optional in Unity below version 2018.3).
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922190959481.png )
4. Export the project as an Xcode project and modify the attributes dependent on `tersafe2.framework` in the main game target to **Embed & Sign**:
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/image-20210922191833270.png )
5. The SDK doesn't support bitcode; therefore, you need to disable bitcode in Xcode during compilation as shown below:
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/29/sdk_ios_c_02.png)

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```csharp
void Tp2SdkInitEx (int gameId, string appKey );
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--- | --- | ---|
|gameId | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|appKey | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_Anti-cheat%20SDK/30/clipboard_20220126_042604.png)

* **User login API**

**Function prototype**

```csharp
void Tp2UserLogin (int account_type, int world_id, string open_id, string role_id);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|account_type | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `Tp2Entry` below |
|world_id | Region information of the user's game character |
|open_id | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string and cannot contain special symbols. It is required if punishment is involved |
|role_id | ID of the character created by the user |

For `account_type`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```csharp
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
public enum Tp2Entry{
    ENTRY_ID_QZONE = 1,   // QQ
    ENTRY_ID_MM  = 2,  // WeChat
    ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK  = 3,  // Facebook
    ENTRY_ID_TWITTER  = 4,  // Twitter
    ENTRY_ID_LINE  = 5,  // Line
    ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP  = 6,  // WhatsApp
    ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7, // Game Center
    ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8, // Google Play
    ENTRY_ID_VK = 9, // VK
    ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU = 10, // Kuaishou
    ENTRY_ID_APPLE = 11, // Apple
    ENTRY_ID_OTHERS  = 99,  // Other platforms
};
```

`world_id` is customized by the game. If the game has only one region, you can enter `0`.

`open_id` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

`role_id` is used to distinguish between different characters of the same account in the same region. If there is only one character, you can enter "" (null).

* **Foreground/Background switch API**

**Function prototype**

```csharp
void Tp2SetGamestatus(Tp2GameStatus status);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|--- | ---|
|status | Foreground: Tp2GameStatus.FRONTEND; background: Tp2GameStatus.BACKEND|

```csharp
public enum Tp2GameStatus{

    FRONTEND  = 1, // Foreground
    BACKEND  = 2,  // Background
}
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`Tp2SdkInitEx` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `appKey`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`Tp2UserLogin` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `Tp2UserLogin` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.

`Tp2SetGamestatus` should be called when the game is switched to the foreground/background.
When switching the game from the background to the foreground, call the `Tp2SetGamestatus` API and set the parameter to `Tp2GameStatus.FRONTEND`.
When switching the game from the foreground to the background, pass in the `Tp2GameStatus.BACKEND` parameter value.
Some features of the SDK will stop running if the game is switched to the background. Therefore, this API will affect the normal operations of SDK features.
```

```csharp
private void Awake () {

    // It is first called when the game is started
    Tp2Sdk.Tp2SdkInitEx(9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");
}

private void Start () {
    int account_type = (int)Tp2Entry.ENTRY_ID_QZONE; /*Account type related to the operations platform*/
    int world_id = 101;  /*Region information of the user's game character*/
    string open_id = "B73B36366565F9E02C7525516DCF31 C2"; /*Account ID related to the login platform*/
    string role_id = "paladin"; /*ID of the character created by the user*/
    Tp2Sdk.Tp2UserLogin(account_type, world_id, open_id, role_id);
}

// It is called when the game is switched to the foreground/background
void OnApplicationPause (bool pause) {
    if (pause) {
        Tp2Sdk.Tp2SetGamestatus (Tp2GameStatus.BACKEND);
    } else {
        Tp2Sdk.Tp2SetGamestatus (Tp2GameStatus.FRONTEND);
    }
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

For Android:

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. To combat cheats, make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game package name has been added to the Android channel information in service management.
3. Check whether the feature of forced quit based on either-or can be normally used.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

1. Use a cheat to check whether the features of forced quit for trainers, speed adjusters, and VMs and either-or work. For the specific effect of cheat defense, please watch [this video](https://v.qq.com/x/page/y0868v09qgj.html) (note: to get the sample cheats used in the video, please contact the customer service).
2. Go to the [data query](#/console/service/query-data) page to check whether the relevant cheating information is displayed (note: there is a 5-minute delay for data display).

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_Anti-cheat%20SDK/30/clipboard_20220126_042837.png)

For iOS:

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. Make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game client has been connected to the iOS broadcasting API.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

In 30–60 seconds after the SDK is started, check whether the following data is printed in the string data returned by the client broadcasting API; and if so, the SDK is properly started.

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/inner_csharp_11.png)

## Data Privacy Compliance APIs

**Though cheats are less likely to happen in some games, they can be exposed to data privacy compliance risks arising from the SDK. Using data privacy compliance APIs in SDK 5.9.20 and above, you can disable anti-cheat data collection and anti-cheat of the SDK, reducing data collection and improving data privacy compliance.**

#### (Optional) Disabling data collection for Android devices with the API

The API is provided to configure the SDK to not collect data you want to protect from the Android device. You can call the API as needed.

The SDK can be configured to not collect the following information: the device screen resolution, SD card path, files path in the SD card, CPU name, application debugging status, application certificate, certificate author, certificate environment, CPU model, device manufacturer, device model, and VPN status.

***Function prototype***

```csharp
// `NULL` is not allowed.
string Tp2Ioctl(string cmd);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
|cmd | Specifies what information will not be collected. `NULL` is not allowed.|

The values of `cmd` are shown in the table below. To not collect the information you want to protect, you can perform the bitwise OR operation (|) on the corresponding parameter value to calculate a hex integer, and pass the value formatted in "CloseDevInfoCollect: 0x%x" to `cmd`.

For example: To not collect all information, enter cmd="CloseDevInfoCollect:0xfff". To not collect the screen resolution, manufacturer, and model of the device, then enter cmd="CloseDevInfoCollect:0x601".

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ---- | ----- | -----|
| 0x00000001 | Screen resolution of the device | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000002 | Path of the SD card | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000004 | Files path in the SD card | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000008 | CPU name | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000010 | Debugging status of the application | The SDK capability to detect debuggers such as IDA will be reduced. |
| 0x00000020 | Certificate of the application | The SDK will fail to detect the cracked versions. |
| 0x00000040 | Author of the application’s certificate | The SDK will fail to detect the cracked versions. |
| 0x00000080 | Environment of the application’s certificate | The SDK capability to detect the cracked versions will be reduced. |
| 0x00000100 | CPU model | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000200 | Manufacturer of the device | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000400 | Device model | The analysis of anti-cheat data will be affected. |
| 0x00000800 | VPN status | The SDK capability to detect the suspicious network will be reduced. |

***When to call the function***

Make an API call right after the SDK initialization API is called. The call can also be made before players log in.

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    // Disable the collection of all information.
    Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseDevInfoCollect:0xfff");
     // Disable the collection of the screen resolution, manufacturer, and model of the device.
      Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseDevInfoCollect:0x601");
      // Disable the collection of the CPU name, certificate of the application and CPU model.
      Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseDevInfoCollect:0x128");
}
```

#### (Optional) Disabling specific scanning with the API

The API is provided to configure the SDK to not collect data from specific scanning. When cheats are less likely to happen in the game application, you can call the API as needed.

The SDK can be configured to disable scanning of the following items: the installed applications (Android), device environment (Android + iOS), emulator (Android + iOS), resource profiler (Android), and cloud phone (Android + iOS).

***Function prototype***

```csharp
// `NULL` is not allowed.
string Tp2Ioctl(string cmd);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
| -----|----| 
|cmd | Specifies the SDK scanning feature to be disabled. `NULL` is not allowed.|

The values of `cmd` are shown in the table below.

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| CloseAPKCollect | Scans the applications installed on the Android device. | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be reduced. |
| CloseUserTagScan | Scans the device environment. | After it is disabled, the device environment of the SDK cannot be detected, such as whether it is rooted or jailbroken. |
| CloseEmulatorScan | Scans the emulator environment. | The SDK capability to scan the emulator will be disabled. |
| CloseAntiProfiler | Disables defense capabilities of the resource profiler. | The SDK capability to detect and protect the resource profiler will be disabled. |
| CloseCloudPhoneScan | Scans the cloud phone environment. | The SDK capability to detect the cloud phone will be disabled. |

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called.

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    //Disable the collection of the installed applications.
    Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseAPKCollect");
    //Disable the collection of the device environment.
     Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseUserTagScan");
     //Disable the scanning of the emulator.
      Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseEmulatorScan");
     //Disable the defense capabilities of the resource profiler.
     Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseAntiProfiler");
    //Disable the scanning of the cloud phone.
    Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("CloseCloudPhoneScan");
}
```

#### (Optional) Enable the collection of the installed applications.

**For privacy compliance,<font color="#dd0000">Based on SDK5.9.27 and SDK6.1.7 and above, the security SDK disables the application installation list scanning function on Android devices by default, While improving privacy compliance, the overall security SDK's plug-in detection capability is reduced</font>**

**Against this background,The security SDK provides an interface to enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device. The project team with a high risk of plug-in can actively inform the user and declare the permission to obtain the user's application list based on the actual needs.By calling this interface, the SDK's application installation list scanning function is enabled, which greatly improves the SDK's plug-in detection capability.**

***Function prototype***

```csharp
// `NULL` is not allowed.
string Tp2Ioctl(string cmd);
```

***Parameter description***

| Parameter | Description |
| -----|----| 
| cmd | "AllowAPKCollect"| 

For example: To enable application list scanning on Android devices, enter cmd="AllowAPKCollect". 

| Parameter Value | Description | Impact |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| AllowAPKCollect | Enable the scanning function of the application installation list on the Android device | The SDK capability to detect cheats will be improved.|

***When to call the function***

Make an API call before the SDK initialization API is called.

```csharp

private void Awake () {
    //Enable the collection of the installed applications.
     Tp2Sdk.Tp2Ioctl("AllowAPKCollect");
}
```
