* If your game has a global edition, please [contact the customer service](https://admin.qidian.qq.com/template/blue/mp/menu/qr-code-jump.html?linkType=0&env=ol&kfuin=2852167644&fid=28&key=d81ab0145faf07ade8b35f63efae4464&cate=1&type=16&ftype=1&_type=wpa&qidian=true) to get the guide on how to connect global game domain names and IPs to Anti-cheat SDK. (<font color="#dd0000">Anti-cheat SDK collects necessary user data to detect cheat behaviors. Please read the information in the data collection form in the SDK package carefully before connecting to and using the SDK.</font>)

## Precautions for Connection

```xml
1. Anti-cheat SDK supports Android and iOS but not Windows. When debugging a program on Windows, you can use a macro to isolate the SDK features. When releasing your game on the public network, be sure to enable the macro so that the SDK can work properly;
2. We recommend you consider adding a switch to block third-party libraries if your game is connected to any third-party component. In this way, you can block such libraries to troubleshoot issues.
3. The JAR file related to Anti-cheat SDK cannot be obfuscated (for Android only).
4. We recommend you connect your game to both Anti-cheat SDK and broadcasting API to better combat cheats.
5. The reinforcement solution is a complement to the Anti-cheat solution and can effectively protect the stable running of the SDK. Using both the solutions together can deliver a better protection effect.
6. In order for Anti-cheat SDK to effectively defend against cheats, the Anti-cheat service must be within the validity period, and you must add the project package name of the game through the channel information in game management in the console.
```

## Overview

* To connect to the SDK, you need to complete the following steps:

```xml
1. Copy the SDK's dynamic library to the specified project directory based on the OS of the game and the CPU architecture supported by the game.
2. Call the SDK APIs based on the user login information.
3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected.
```

* The following files are required for connecting an Android game developed in C or C++ to the SDK:

```xml
tp2.jar
tp2_sdk.h
libtersafe2.so
```

* The following permissions are required:

```xml
<!-- The SDK needs to collect the list of application installed on Android devices, and Android 11 requires declaration of the corresponding permission.
If `targetSdkVersion` of the application is equal to or above 30, you need to add the following permission in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file; otherwise, the SDK features will be affected: -->
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES" />
<!-- Optional permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

* SDK APIs:

```xml
1. Initialization API: tp2_sdk_init_ex
2. User login API: tp2_setuserinfo
3. Foreground/Background switch API: tp2_setgamestatus
```

* Notes:

```xml
1. The original initialization API `tp2_sdk_init` of the SDK has been disused and replaced with `tp2_sdk_init_ex` with the `app_key` parameter added.
```

## Connection Directions

### Step 1. Add SDK files to the project

1. Copy the `tp2.jar` file in the `sdk_android_c` directory to the `libs` directory in the Android project directory.
2. Copy the `tp2_sdk.h` file in the `sdk_android_c` directory to the `jni` directory in the Android project directory.
3. Copy the folders named after CPU architectures (including the `libtersafe2.so` file) in the `sdk_android_c_lib` directory to the corresponding `jni_` directories in the Android project directory, such as `jni_armeabi` and `jni_x86`. There is no need to copy a folder if the corresponding CPU architecture isn't supported.

#### Project attribute settings

1. In Eclipse, select your game project in **Project Explorer** on the left, right-click and select **Properties** in the pop-up menu, select **Java Build Path** on the left in the **Properties** window, and click **Add JARs** in **Library** to add `tp2.jar`.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/sdk_Android_c_02.jpg)
2. Select the `tp2.jar` file that has been copied to the project directory.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/sdk_Android_c_03.jpg)
3. After adding `tp2.jar`, select it in **Order and Export**.
   ![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/26/sdk_Android_c_04.jpg)
4. Add reference to `libtersafe2.so` in the place whether the Android project loads the game's .so files and modify the .mk file.

```java
// `libtersafe2.so` must be loaded before the game's .so files
public class Game{
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("tersafe2");
        System.loadLibrary("game");
    }
}
```

```makefile
# Add the following code to `jin/Android.mk` to load `libtersafe2.so`:
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := libtp2
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(TARGET_ARCH_ABI)/libtersafe2.so
include $(PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY)
```

```makefile
# Add the following code to the .so node where the game is located in `jni/Android.mk` to import `libtp2`:
 LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES += libtp2
```

### Step 2. Call SDK APIs

* **Header file**

```c++
include "tp2_sdk.h"
```

* **Initialization API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
int tp2_sdk_init_ex(int game_id, const char* app_key);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|--- | -- | --|
|game_id | Yes | `game_id` assigned by ACE |
|app_key | Yes | `game_key` assigned by ACE, which corresponds to `game_id` |

`gameId` and `appKey` will be automatically generated after you register your game in [ACE](#/console/service/overview) and can be viewed in **Service Management** as shown below:

![ ](/docs/ACE-doc/10_mobile-SDK/25/sdk_Android.png)

* **User login API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
// If 0 is returned, the API is successfully called
int tp2_setuserinfo(int account_type, int world_id, const char *open_id, const char *role_id);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|-----|
|account_type | Account type related to the operations platform. You should enter it by referring to `TssSdkEntryId` below |
|world_id | Region information of the user's game character |
|open_id | Unique user ID, which can be a custom string and cannot contain special symbols. It is required if punishment is involved |
|role_id | ID of the character created by the user |

For `account_type`, enter `1` for the QQ platform, `2` for the WeChat platform, and `99` for other platforms by default. For values of other mainstream account login platforms in and outside the Chinese mainland, please see below:

```c++
// The login entries of Game Center, Google Play, VK, Kuaishou, and Apple take effect on SDK versions above 4.6
enum TssSdkEntryId{
    ENTRY_ID_QZONE = 1,   // QQ
    ENTRY_ID_MM  = 2,  // WeChat
    ENTRT_ID_FACEBOOK  = 3,  // Facebook
    ENTRY_ID_TWITTER  = 4,  // Twitter
    ENTRY_ID_LINE  = 5,  // Line
    ENTRY_ID_WHATSAPP  = 6,  // WhatsApp
    ENTRY_ID_GAMECENTER = 7, // Game Center
    ENTRY_ID_GOOGLEPLAY = 8, // Google Play
    ENTRY_ID_VK = 9, // VK
    ENTRY_ID_KUAISHOU = 10, // Kuaishou
    ENTRY_ID_APPLE = 11, // Apple
    ENTRY_ID_OTHERS  = 99,  // Other platforms
}
```

`world_id` is customized by the game. If the game has only one region, you can enter `0`.

`role_id` is used to distinguish between different characters of the same account in the same region. If there is only one character, you can enter "" (null).

`open_id` is assigned by the operations platform of the game and used to uniquely identify a user.

* **Foreground/Background switch API**

**Function prototype**

```c++
int tp2_setgamestatus (int status);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|--- | ---|
|status | Foreground: TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND; background: TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND|

```c++
enum TP2GameStatus{
    TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND = 1,    // Foreground
    TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND = 2,    // Background
}
```

* **Call time sequence**

```xml
`tp2_sdk_init_ex` should be first called when the game is started, and its parameters are the game ID and `app_key`.
If you call the SDK APIs earlier, you can better protect the game process.

`tp2_setuserinfo` should be called after the game gets the login information authorized by the user.
If there are region IDs and character IDs in the game, call the `tp2_setuserinfo` API after getting the region and character IDs.
During gameplay, if the game is disconnected and connected again, this API needs to be called again to get the user login information for operations such as login again after logout. The parameters passed in are the user account information, which can be customized.

`tp2_setgamestatus` should be called when the game is switched to the foreground/background.
When switching the game from the background to the foreground, call the `tp2_setgamestatus` API and set the parameter to `TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND`.
When switching the game from the foreground to the background, pass in the `TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND` parameter value.
Some features of the SDK will stop running if the game is switched to the background. Therefore, this API will affect the normal operations of SDK features.
```

```c++
void game_start() {

    // It is first called when the game is started
    tp2_sdk_init_ex (9000, "d5ab8dc7ef67ca92e41d730982c5c602");

    // It is called when the user logs in
    int account_type = ENTRY_ID_QZONE;  /*Account type*/
    int world_id = 101;  /*Region ID*/
    char open_id[] = "B73B36366565F9E02C752";/*User ID related to the platform*/
    char role_id[] = "paladin"; /*Character ID*/
    tp2_setuserinfo(account_type, world_id, open_id, role_id);
};

// Switch the game to the background
int game_pause(){
    return tp2_setgamestatus(TP2_GAME_STATUS_BACKEND);
}

// Switch the game to the foreground
int game_resume(){
    return tp2_setgamestatus(TP2_GAME_STATUS_FRONTEND);
}
```

### Step 3. Check whether the SDK is properly connected

Precautions for checking SDK connection:

```xml
1. To combat cheats, make sure that the SDK APIs including those for initialization, user login, and foreground/background switch have been called on the game client.
2. Check whether the game package name has been added to the channel information in ACE.
3. Check whether the feature of forced quit based on either-or can be normally used.
```

Directions for checking SDK connection:

1. Use a cheat to check whether the features of forced quit for trainers, speed adjusters, and VMs and either-or work. For the specific effect of cheat defense, please watch [this video](https://v.qq.com/x/page/y0868v09qgj.html) (note: to get the sample cheats used in the video, please contact the customer service).
2. Go to the [data query](#/console/service/query-data) page to check whether the relevant cheating information is displayed (note: there is a 5-minute delay for data display).
